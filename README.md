# Libraries (that I have used) Review

In my journey as a web dev I have been used tons of library, lots are really good, some aren't. I will, as the name said, review them and share what I have experienced from them â€” mind you that these are going to be highly subjective reviews (since I'm writing them based on what happened _to me_) and might work or later be working with you or in the newer version.

So, ready to cause some drama? Here we go ðŸ‘‡

- **Score:** 10/10 would use it on every project
- **Pros:**
  - Easy and modular, you need scroll detect? use `scroll`. Intersection Observer? `inView`.
- **Cons:**
  - Still have to look up docs what does what. `scroll` took function as first param and specify the element in option but `inView` took element as a first parameter. I respect for the design tho but like my brain still forget them time to time.
  - Timeline and animation can get very tedious with complex transformation + timing.
  - `inView` is bugging with threashold 1 and 0? might be just me. Also, the function, to return or not to return â€” that is the question. Still, respect them for the design tho.

- **Score:** 9/10 would use it on every project
- **Pros:**
  - Modular and super customizable, which can cover wide ranges of use like a popover, a menu, a dropdown, anything that required anchoring something to something.
- **Cons:**
  - Required you to open the tutorial every single time you want to use. Highly customizable, but also tedious to do a simple tooltip (which to be fair if you just want a simple tooltip, just use [Popper](https://popper.js.org/)).
